# MARTA thin-gaps + pulse (low-frequency / blackout detection)

The mainline bus detectors are structurally blind to low-frequency and fully
silent routes:

- **gaps** needs ≥2 buses on the same shape (`group.length < 2 → skip`).
- **ghosts** needs `MISSING_ABS_THRESHOLD = 3` missing trips.
- **bunching** needs ≥2 co-located buses.

So a 30-min-headway route that simply stops running, or a frequent route that
goes completely dark, produces no detection. CTA closed this with two extra
detectors; this is the MARTA port (2026-06-16, from the suppression audit).

## thin-gaps — low-frequency routes (`bin/marta/bus/thin-gaps.js`)

Eligible routes: bus routes whose **current scheduled headway ≥ 20 min**
(`headwayForLine`). For each, ask a binary question: has *any* bus been observed
in `max(2 × headway, 60 min)`? If not — and the route has steady-state service
in both the prior and next hour (ramp-up / wind-down guards) — fire.

- Pure core: `src/marta/bus/thinGaps.js` (verbatim CTA port).
- One post per route per day (24h cooldown); rollup thread to the bus account.
- Records an `observed-thin` row in `disruption_events` (standalone website
  incident) + a `thin-gap` `meta_signal` (roundup correlation).
- Threads a "buses observed on the route again" clear reply when a bus reappears;
  a synthetic (no-reply) clear closes firings older than the 24h reply window.

## pulse — route blackouts (`bin/marta/bus/pulse.js`)

The complement: bus routes whose **current headway < 20 min** (higher-frequency).
Fires when a route that should have **≥2 active buses** shows **zero distinct
vehicles** in a headway-scaled lookback (3× longest-direction headway, clamped to
25–60 min) while the rest of the fleet reports normally.

- Pure core: `src/marta/bus/pulse.js` (verbatim CTA `detectBusBlackouts`; CTA's
  `heldClusters` sub-detector is **deferred**).
- Guards: feed-stale (newest fleet observation > 5 min → upstream outage),
  pipeline-wide-quiet (<5 other active routes), cold-start grace (no obs in 6h),
  lookback-quiet probe (ramp), and wind-down (last 30 min of final service hour).
- 2h re-post cooldown; records `observed` / `pulse-cold`; same clear-reply
  lifecycle as thin-gaps.

The 20-min headway boundary partitions the two cleanly so a route is never both a
thin-gap and a pulse candidate.

## rail pulse — dead track segments (`bin/marta/rail/pulse.js`)

The rail analog of the CTA train pulse: it flags a **stretch of track between
stations that no train has passed through when the schedule says one should
have** — e.g. a stalled or suspended corridor. The mainline rail **gap** detector
(`src/marta/rail/gaps.js`) is blind to this because it needs ≥2 live trains on the
line to measure a hole *between* them; a stalled or fully-dark corridor produces
no pair to compare.

- Pure core: `src/marta/rail/pulse.js` (`detectDeadSegments`, `detectFeedGap`),
  the CTA `src/train/pulse.js` port collapsed to MARTA's four point-to-point lines
  and N/S/E/W feed directions. One representative geometry per line
  (`rail/lines.js`); the detector bins each line by along-track distance and scans
  **once per feed direction**, treating a bin as "cold" when no train going that
  direction has projected into it within `max(2.5× headway, 15 min)` (verbatim CTA
  thresholds; the 1-station "solo" admit path needs 3.5× headway).
- A candidate is admitted via any of three paths: `passLong` (run ≥ 2 mi),
  `passMulti` (≥ 2 stations inside the cold run), or `passSolo` (≥ 1 station +
  ≥ 3 expected-but-missed trains + ≥ 3.5× headway cold). Generic FP guards kept
  from CTA: terminal-zone clip, active-service-range clip + pinned ranges, ramp-up
  (2 h lookback), fast-traversal ("crossed"), feed-gap, cold-start / sparse-
  coverage / sparse-span, terminal-adjacency margin, dispatch-continuity, plus the
  inferred-held reclassification (relabels a cold run as "trains stuck" when a
  train's GPS goes silent stationary mid-segment). CTA's Loop-trunk / Express-
  overlay / round-trip-turnaround machinery is dropped (no MARTA analog).
- Posts to **`@martaalertinsights`** (not the train account) — it's framed as a
  service disruption, threads under any open official MARTA rail alert for the
  line (`alert/store.js#findUnresolvedRailAlertForLine`), and ✅-clears. Renders a
  CTA-style **suspended-segment map**: the affected stretch is drawn solid but
  dimmed (0.4 opacity) between white station-pin markers, the rest of the line
  bright (`map/railIncidents.js#renderRailDisruptionMap`).
- Per-(line, direction) debounce lives in the `pulse_state` table
  (`src/marta/storage.js`): posts after `MIN_CONSECUTIVE_TICKS = 3` ticks of
  ≥ 50% run overlap, clears after `CLEAR_TICKS_TO_RESET = 5` clean ticks;
  `active_post_uri` pins the canonical post. When a whole line goes dark while the
  schedule says it should run, a **synthetic full-line candidate** is flagged.
- Records `observed` / `observed-held` (and `observed-clear`) `disruption_events`
  with the from/to segment in `evidence`; the web export surfaces them standalone.
- Cron: `rail-pulse`, every 2 min (even minutes, offset from the official-alerts
  job) in `cron/marta-crontab.txt`.

## Website surfacing

Unlike a lone gap/bunch/ghost (which only reaches the site folded into a roundup
or official alert), thin-gap and pulse firings surface **standalone** — a silent
route has no co-occurring signal to correlate. `bin/marta/export-web.js`
(`readDisruptions`) reads posted `observed-thin` → `thin-gap`, `observed` /
`observed-held` → `pulse-cold` rows, pairs each with the next `observed-clear` on
the same line, and emits a `['bot']` incident with the firing→clear lifecycle.
Rail dead-segment rows (`kind = 'rail'`) carry the from/to segment in `evidence`,
so their incident description names the stretch (`Gold Line trains not moving
between Lenox and Chamblee`) and `scope.near_stop` carries `"<from> ↔ <to>"`; bus
route-silence rows keep their whole-route phrasing.

## Gap cooldown alignment

Independently, `incidents.gapCooldownAllows` was aligned with CTA: a within-1h gap
re-posts when it clears a **decaying margin** (1.25× when the prior post is fresh
→ 1.1× as it ages) **or** when it's a **sustained severe** gap (≥20 min after the
prior post and still ≥3.0× headway). This replaced a flat 1.25× that suppressed
sustained/aged escalations CTA re-posts.
