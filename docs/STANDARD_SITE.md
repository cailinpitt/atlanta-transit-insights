# standard.site (enhanced Bluesky link cards)

[standard.site](https://standard.site) is a set of AT Protocol lexicons for
publishing. When a web page can be tied back to a `site.standard.publication`
plus a `site.standard.document` record on the publisher's repo, Bluesky upgrades
the generic link card to an **enhanced card** (publication name, attribution,
reading time). We publish those records for the MARTA archive so links to
`atlantatransitalerts.app` — both the bot's own posts and anyone else's shares —
render as first-class cards.

Records live on the **ALERTS** account's repo (`@martaalertinsights`), which
already posts the archive links.

## The two paths to an enhanced card

Both are used; they're independent.

1. **Post-side (`associatedRefs`).** When `bin/marta/alerts.js` posts a resolved
   event's archive card, it attaches `associatedRefs` (the document + publication
   strong refs) to the `app.bsky.embed.external`. Helps the bot's own posts
   immediately; needs no page/path match. Wired via
   `src/marta/shared/bluesky.js#postWithExternal` (new 5th arg) and
   `src/marta/shared/standardSite.js#eventAssociatedRefs`.

2. **Page-side (`<link>` tags + well-known).** Each canonical `/event/<id>` page
   declares its document record; the home page + every page declare the
   publication; and `/.well-known/site.standard.publication` returns the
   publication AT-URI (the *mandatory* half of verification — the `<link>` tag is
   only a hint). Helps *anyone* who shares an event permalink. Implemented in the
   frontend (`atlanta-transit-alerts`): `scripts/prerender-standard-site.js`
   (shell tag + well-known) and `scripts/prerender-events.js` (per-event document
   tag).

## Records

- **Publication** — rkey `self`, so its AT-URI is deterministic:
  `at://<did>/site.standard.publication/self`. Fields: `url`, `name`,
  `description`.
- **Document** — one per event, rkey = the event's `/event/<id>` slug (the
  Bluesky post rkey), so the record's `path` (`/event/<id>`) matches the page.

`putRecord` is create-or-replace, so publishing is idempotent. The installed
`@atproto/api` lexicon doesn't know `site.standard.*` (or `associatedRefs`) yet,
so the client passes them through unvalidated — matching how other standard.site
publishers create these records.

## Local state + the manifest

`src/marta/shared/standardSite.js` persists what it has published to
`state/standard-site.json` (gitignored, alongside `marta.sqlite`):

```json
{ "publication": { "did", "uri", "cid", "hash" },
  "documents": { "<rkey>": { "did", "cid", "hash" } } }
```

`bin/marta/export-standard-site.js` turns that state into the public manifest
(`standard-site.json`, published to R2 next to `alerts.json`):

```json
{ "publication": "at://<did>/site.standard.publication/self",
  "documents": { "<rkey>": "at://<did>/site.standard.document/<rkey>" } }
```

The manifest carries AT-URIs only (page-side verification needs no cids) and has
no `generated_at`, so it's byte-stable when nothing changed and doesn't trigger a
needless rebuild. The frontend reads it at build time.

## Operations

1. **Mint + backfill (one-time, then periodic reconcile).** On the server:

   ```sh
   node scripts/backfill-standard-site.js --dry-run   # preview
   node scripts/backfill-standard-site.js             # ensure publication + all docs
   ```

   It reads the published `alerts.json` (so manifest keys match the deployed
   site), ensures the publication record, and publishes a document for every
   incident that has an `/event` page. Idempotent — safe to re-run on a cadence to
   pick up bot-only events and enrich the minimal records the live path creates.
   These are repo writes (`com.atproto.repo.putRecord`), **not** timeline posts.

2. **Publish the manifest.** `bin/marta/push-web-data.sh` regenerates and uploads
   `standard-site.json` on every run; or run `bin/marta/export-standard-site.js
   <out>` directly. After that, the next site build injects the tags + well-known.

No new env vars are required (`STANDARD_SITE` state path defaults under
`state/`). Uses the existing `BLUESKY_ALERTS_{IDENTIFIER,APP_PASSWORD}`.
